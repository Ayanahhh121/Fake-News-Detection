# Fake-News-Detection
This project focuses on detecting fake news articles using deep learning techniques. With the increasing spread of misinformation, it is crucial to develop automated systems to identify and mitigate the impact of fake news. By leveraging deep learning models, we aim to build an effective tool for distinguishing between real and fake news.
